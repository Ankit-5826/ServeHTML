# Static HTML Server (Node.js)

A minimal Node.js server for serving static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

This project is designed as a **simple starter template**.  
Users only need to place their website files inside the `public/` folder and run the server.  
No frameworks, no build tools, no configuration.
